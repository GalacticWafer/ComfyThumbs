### 97.98% Keycap Compatibility

This is the most keycap-compatible, split, ortholinear, tenkey-less keyboard. Space and Backspace are the only keys that are not traditionally-sized. That means you won't need to buy/use different keycaps for `Right Shift`, `Left Shift`, `Enter`, `Tab`, `\ `, `Command`, `Ctrl`, `Alt`, `OS`, and `Application` keys.

### Use your thumbs without hurting them

|Thumb Cluster Style|# of keys|Avg. reach from Home Position|
|---|---|---|
|ComfyThumbs|5|1u
|Manuform/Dactyl-Manuform|6|3.5u
|Maltron/Dacyl/Kenesis/Ergodox|6-8|4.5u

Unlike other large thumb cluster designs that waste valuable space by pushing the cluster away from resting thumb position or building the cluster on a curve, all thumb keys (colored grey) are within 1u radius of resting position. The thumbs naturally rest on either Space or Backspace, with all modifiers nearby. The thumb clusters cover two rows. `Space`, `Backspace`, and both `Shift` keys have a higher profile on the upper thumb row, and use stem raisers to distinguish thumb location without looking. Using SA keycaps for these 4 keys is another option to get the profile difference, but we like keycap compatibility :grinning:


### Comfy Thumbs = Comfy Pinkies
Your pinkies have been doing way more work than they should. That's why modifiers have moved to the thumb cluster. Adding to that, `-` and `=` are in more favorable positions, and the index fingers have a new inner column (colored orange) with two optional rotary encoders.

### Still want layers?
The bottom left and right Fn keys can be used to access QMK keyboard layers. The NumLock key can be used to turn on a tenkey layer. In the end, this is QMK - just explore and decide what you like!
